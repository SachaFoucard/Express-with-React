Connection Express with React
# Conclusion üèÅ
There you have it! In summary, connecting a React frontend to an Express backend is simple. It just requires you to fetch data from the port that the backend server is located on. I didn‚Äôt cover PUT or DELETE requests, but those are very similar to POST requests, so you can learn how to do those very easily with the knowledge I gave above. And I really recommend learning the MERN stack if you‚Äôre not sure what full stack development stack to choose because MERN is extremely powerful once you learn how to connect React with Express.
